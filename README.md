# boilerplate (React, Node, Express)

The boilerplate can be used to setup a React web app with a Node / Express backend.

This boilerplate provides you the ability to:
  1. Render React using react and react-dom
  2. Transpile es6 using babel-loader and @babel/core
  3. Compile JSX for react using babel preset: @babel/preset-react
  4. Bundle modules into JavaScript using webpack
  5. Creates index.html when webpack compiles using html-webpack-plugin
  
  
  npm -y init
  command line: npx webpack
